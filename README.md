PICA::Record is a Perl module for handling PICA+ records. There are
classes and methods for reading in, manipulating, and outputting
bibliographic records in PICA+ in different ways. This also includes
an XML representation of PICA+ and connection to some interfaces 
to PICA systems for downloading or uploading PICA+ records.

For a more detailed introduction have a look at the documentation,
at example scripts, and tests in this distribution.
